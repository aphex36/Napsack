# Knapsack

This project is a web app aimed providing a link aggregator application like Reddit only improving on the UI and 
allowing the user to post anonymously

To run this program have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your computer then:

1) cd into the project, and run un mongod --dbpath dataStorage (I put the file there for convenience, don't have to run the storage there if you don't want to)
2) In another terminal run "node startingServer.js" (in the same directory earlier)
3) Visit localhost:3000

I published this web app using AWS:
