This project is a web app aimed providing a link aggregator application like Reddit only improving on the UI and 
allowing the user to post anonymously

To run this program have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your computer then:

1) cd into the project, and create a folder <folderName> (could be whatever you want it to be)

2) run "mongod --dbpath <folderName>" while in the project

3) In another terminal run "node startingServer.js" (in the same directory earlier)

4) Visit localhost:3000

I published this web app using AWS:
